It was known that the speed of mechanical waves is determined by the elastic and inertial properties of the medium. In particular, the formula v = √(ε/ρ), where ɛ is a measure of elasticity and ρ the density of the medium, was confirmed for the speed of sound in solids, liquids and gases. For sound waves, ɛ denotes the bulk modulus of the medium.<br>All mechanical waves need a medium to transmit them. It was, therefore, natural to think that light waves too would need a medium to travel through. This assumed medium was called 'ether'. The 'ether' was thought to occupy all space (that otherwise seemed empty) and to penetrate all matter. The same formula (given above) that worked for the speed of sound was assumed to be valid for the speed of light waves in 'ether'. The speed of light was known to be about a million times greater than the speed of sound in air.<br>Two types of mechanical waves were known: longitudinal (such as sound waves) and transverse waves (such as those on a taut string). To transmit transverse waves, the medium must tend to restore to its original shape when deformed, that is, it should possess what is known as 'shear modulus of elasticity'. Since only solids have fixed shapes, mechanical transverse waves can travel only in a solid medium. For explaining some important observations (for example, polarization properties of light), Young and Fresnel concluded that light must be a transverse wave.<br><br><b>Question 1.1:</b> According to Young and Fresnel's wave theory of light,",

        "C": "the 'ether' must be a highly dilute gaseous medium.",
