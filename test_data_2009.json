If the system is not isolated but can exchange energy and/or matter with its environment, the First Law may be applied to the universe, that is, to the system plus its environment. But the First Law cannot determine the direction of spontaneous change. This is governed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which introduces a new variable of the system called entropy. Entropy, roughly speaking, is a measure of molecular disorder. According to the Second Law, the entropy of the universe always increases for spontaneous processes of nature. This restriction, however, says nothing about the rate of the spontaneous process.<br>A process is reversible if at every stage the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium and the change from one equilibrium state to another is infinitely slow. Further, a reversible process involves no dissipative effects (such as friction, viscosity, etc.). The entropy of the universe remains constant in a reversible process. Spontaneous processes are irreversible.<br>The First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics are never violated in nature. It is possible to express the Second Law (under certain conditions) in terms of the variables of the system alone. For example, for spontaneous processes occurring at constant temperature (T) and pressure (P), the Gibbs Free Energy (G) [which is a combination of other thermodynamic variables] of the system never increases, being constant for reversible processes. Some biological processes at constant T and P, however, are required to go in the direction of increasing G.<br><br><b>Question 1.1:</b> For all reversible processes, [Here the symbols ΔS and ΔG mean change in entropy and Gibbs Free Energy respectively.]",
