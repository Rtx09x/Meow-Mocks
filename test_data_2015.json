The phrase comes from the fact that typically the shape of this graph looks like a pyramid when the population is growing. It is also used to infer about the reproductive patterns and likelihood of the continuation of a community. It typically consists of two back-to-back bar graphs, with the population plotted on the X-axis and age intervals on the Y-axis. The left part is typically used for showing males and right for showing females in a particular population in five-year age groups (also called cohorts). Often there tend to be more females than males in the older age groups, due to longer life expectancy of females.<br>Population pyramids can be classified in three types. An \"expansive pyramid\" is very wide at the base, indicating high birth rates and lower life expectancy. A \"stationary pyramid\" shows an unchanging pattern (execept for older age groups) of low fertility and low mortality. A \"constrictive pyramid\" or \"onion shaped pyramid\" is a pyramid that contracts at the bottom. This pyramid is a typical pattern for very devloped countries, especially when immigrants are factored out. It is indicative of longer life expectancy, a low death rate, but also a low birth rate.<br>The expansive case is sometimes called as \"youth bulge\". Social scientists take special interest in effects of youth bulge on a society. For example, a large population of adolescents entering the labour force may either put strain on the economy due to high unemployment or give a \"demographic advantage\" due to availability of large human resource.<br><br><b>Question 1.1:</b> The population pyramid on the right is an example of <br><img src='{IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX}general_q1_1.png' alt='Population pyramid for United States - 2014'>",

The process of organic plant material getting converted into coal is called coalification. Accumulation of plant debris in a swamp where the stagnant water prevents oxidation and total decomposition of the organic matter, results in 'peat swamps'. Coal mined from such swamp is called humic coal. In peat swamps, aerobic bacteria rapidly oxidise cellulose and other components producing carbon dioxide, ammonia, etc. The de-composed material compacts about 50% of the organic matter. This results in a mixture with a large proportion of lignin. The bacteria quickly use up the available oxygen and die ending the first stage of the process. Then, the anaerobic bacteria take over the decompo-sition process and produce acids as metabolic waste products. When the pH reaches about four, these bacteria die. The product at this stage is a gel-like material called Gytta. Due to geological activity, Gytta may be buried to a depth of 2,000 to 3,000 feet, where the temperature is about 100°C and a thermal process known as bituminisation may begin. At this temperature, water and other volatiles are extruded, leaving behind fixed carbon, ash, sulphur and other trace elements. As this mixture gets buried deeper, the pressures and temperatures cause increased chemical reactions to occur which reduce lignin to hard, black carbon-rich material, which we call coal. Under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, it may get converted to graphite.<br>Coal harnessed at various stages has been categorised in four grades of increasing carbon content: Lignite, Sub-Bituminous, Bituminous, and Anthracite. North America and Asia possess over 25% each and Europe about 30% of world's coal reserves. Asia has a significantly higher proportion of bituminous coal while the sub-bituminous and lignite coals are more prevalent in European reserves. When coal is combusted, the freed sulphur contaminants get converted into a green house gas which may result in acid rain.<br><br><b>Question 1.4:</b> Among the listed countries, the coal reserves of a relatively better quality are likely to be found in",
